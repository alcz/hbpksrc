  + build/cmake/patch-00
    ! Cmake bootstrapped with make on Linux GPFs/crashes in
      Windows registry related routine. Where are we yet
      in this world?

  + build/harbour-core-onedir/Makefile
    + Harbour + contribs not needing external libraries:
      placed under single dir /opt/hbpk/harbour, built
      by Zig cc LLVM wrapper
      resulting package:
      harbour-core-3.2.0dev+zig+onedir.hbpk

  + build/harbour-core/Makefile
    + Harbour + contribs not needing any external libs:
      placed under /opt/hbpk prefix, binary under
      /opt/hbpk/bin, libs under ../lib, etc.
      built by Zig too
      resulting package:
      harbour-core-3.2.0dev+zig.hbpk

  * build/cmake/Makefile
    * tried different revision, due to bug described
      above - no luck. Needed our own patch.

  * build/zig-binary/cc
  * build/zig-binary/clang

    + compiler wrappers, added support for HB_ZIG_TARGET
      variable. Currently use to specify x86_64-linux-musl
      target, so the resulting binaries will work on
      any Linux distribution.

    ; this is the official Zig binary downloaded as is
      from ziglang.org
      repacked as:
      zig-0.15.2+officialbinary.hbpk

  * ../common.mk
    + use HB_ZIG_TARGET on Linux

  * ../pmgr.mk
    + $(PKGBLD) additional package flavour/description

  + ChangeLog.txt
    ; initial commit of package manager - targeted at building C libraries
      (sometimes old versions of them), where rewriting specific Makefiles
      to hbmk2 is not viable

      public domain code from https://github.com/7shi/pmgrsrc
      Many thanks 7shi.
