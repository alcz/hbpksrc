[how to build]

1. export PATH="/opt/hbpk/bin:$PATH"
2. cd base && make install
3. cd build[/PACKAGE] && make install

[command usage]

install:
% hbpk-add PACKAGE-VER.hbpk

uninstall:
% hbpk-del PACKAGE

list installed packages:
% hbpk-ls [package-name]

Thank you!

[extra]
preferably assign yourself to this path:
mkdir -p /opt/hbpk
chown $USER:$USER /opt/hbpk

store the repo in home directory or have multiple build trees:
export HBPK_WORKDIR=$HOME/hbpk
export PATH="$HBPK_WORKDIR:$PATH"
NOTE: this is not very well tested, right now changing HBPK_WORKDIR= need rebuilding base/
